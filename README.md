# Aim: 
To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT - To demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application to organize daily tasks, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.

---

## 🛠️ AI Tool Used
- **ChatGPT** (for generating routine steps and contextual suggestions)

---

## 👩‍💼 Use Case Scenario
**Prompt Context:**  
“You are a 20-year-old girl planning a full day of shopping for clothes and accessories. The assistant should help plan each step of the routine from preparation to return.”

---

# Explanation: 
Prompt:
"Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries. The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable to the user’s changing preferences over time."
Procedure:
1. Define the core requirements of a personal productivity assistant.
2. Identify and construct appropriate prompts for each task using an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT).
3. Simulate natural user interaction through a simple interface or command-line system.
4. Collect feedback or inputs from users and adapt responses accordingly.
5. (Optional) Integrate basic memory to simulate preference adaptation.

EXPECTED OUTPUT: - (attached the drive link)

Output (Example Response by LLM):

Personal Productivity Assistant Features:
1. Daily Task Manager:
o Accept tasks via natural language (e.g., "Remind me to call mom at 6 PM").
o Organize tasks by priority and deadline.
o Provide daily summaries and pending items.

3. Smart Scheduler:
o Schedule events and set reminders using contextual understanding.
o Notify user of overlapping appointments or free time slots.
4. Wellness Tips Generator:
o Suggest daily wellness advice (hydration, exercise, screen-time breaks).
o Adapt suggestions based on past user preferences and responses.

## 🧠 Step-by-Step Algorithm

### ✅ 1. Start

---

### ✅ 2. Initialize Assistant
- Set default values (e.g., departure time, estimated budget)
- (Optional) Ask user for preferences

---

### ✅ 3. Plan Morning Routine

- **Input:** Preferred time to leave  
- **Process:**
  - Generate a morning schedule (wake-up, breakfast, preparation)
  - Include a checklist (wallet, phone, shopping list, etc.)
- **Output:** Time-stamped morning routine

---

### ✅ 4. Plan Shopping Goals

---

### ✅ 5. Add Wellness Reminders

- **Input:** Estimated shopping duration  
- **Process:**
  - Insert reminders for hydration, food, and rest
  - Suggest times for short breaks
- **Output:** Time-stamped wellness check-ins

---

### ✅ 6. Plan Return and Review

- **Estimate:** Return time based on trip duration  
- **Process:**
  - Plan for unpacking and organizing items
  - Prompt user to try on clothes and reflect on purchases
  - Suggest keeping receipts for exchanges
- **Output:** Evening wrap-up plan

---

### ✅ 7. Display Summary
